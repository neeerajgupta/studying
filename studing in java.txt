 9) What is difference between c++ and Java ?
Java                                                C++
1) Java is platform independent                  C++ is platform dependent.
2) There are no pointers in java                 There are pointers in C++.
3) There is no operator overloading in java      C ++ has operator overloading.
4) There is garbage collection in java           There is no garbage collection
5) Supports multithreading                       Does’nt support multithreading
6) There are no templates in java                 There are templates in c++
7) There are no global variables in java          There are global variables in c++



10) What is JIT compiler ?
JIT compiler stands for Just in time compiler. JIT compiler compiles byte code in to executable code . 
JIT a part of JVM .JIT cannot convert complete java program in to executable code it converts as and 
when it is needed during execution.




11) What is bytecode in java ?
When a javac compiler compiler compiles a class it generates .class file. This .class file contains set of 
instructions called byte code. Byte code is a machine independent language and contains set of 
instructions which are to be executed only by JVM. JVM can understand this byte codes.




Jdk (Java Development kits):-






 Test.java===>(Source code)
 compile==> javac Test.java
 
 Compiler do the First WORKS===>test.class( dot class File)
	
jre jdk jvm	==> home work


			Source code==>compiler=>bytecode(0,1 form)==>jvm==> OS===>Output

Identifire:-  Any name of the value ia called identyfire. 
			It may be class name, method name, 
					variable name and label name.
					
					
				==>	Variable is the name of memory location


class Test{     //test is identyfire
public static void main(String [] args)//Main  is identifire
{

int x=10;//x is variable and it is identifire

int *=10; worng
int  a,A,a1,b3

}
}

x=10;
int x=10.0
string s="dsd"
flote
long
double
boolean
array



= H89q0T = 
= H89q0T = 


									DATA TYPE:->
									
									Every variable has a type is called data type 
									like int char float double;
									
	types of DAta type 

1.Pridefine DATA TYPE:-
DataType~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Size
	Byte 				8 bit	2^16=-32768 to 32767
	int					32 bit	2^32=>2147483648 to 2147483647
	folat				32 bit
	char
	double
	boolean
	long





2.User define DAta Type

Array	

Array is User Define data type 
array is homiginious data type it store continious memory locatino


But the main disadvantage of arrays is: 
Fixed in size that is once we created an array there is no chance of increasing or 
decreasing the size based on our requirement that is to use arrays concept compulsory 
we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.



Single dimensional array declaration: 

int [] a;  //4,5,5
int a[];
int []a;
int a [5]={4,5,7,7,8,8};//invalid ==> out of range 
All is valid 



Two dimensional array declaration:


int [5] [5] a;
int a [] [];
int [] a[];
int[][] a;
int[][]a;
int[]a[] ;

All are valid 


Three dimensional array declaration

Example: 
int[][][] a;
int [][][]a;
int a[][][];
int[] [][]a;
int[] a[][]; All are valid.(10 ways)
int[] []a[];
int[][] []a;
int[][] a[];
int []a[][];
int [][]a[];


of the following declarations are valid? 
1) int[] a1,b1;  //valid
2) int[] a2[],b2; //valid
3) int[] []a3,b3; //valid
4) int[] a,[]b;  //valid
int []a;
int []b;


Example:-------------->
public class Test{ 
public static void main(String[] args){ 	
	int [4]a1={10,20,30};
	int []a2={7,5,8,6,3,5,4,1,5,5};
	
	//first approch
	int l=a1.length;
	for(int a=0;a<l;a++){
	System.out.print(a1[a]+"    ");
	}
	System.out.println();
	
	//Second Approch forEAtch loop
	for(int p: a2){
		System.out.print(p+"    ");
	}		  
}
}

0 to 7---> int x=785



Element at index 0 : 10
Element at index 1 : 20
Element at index 2 : 30
Element at index 3 : 40
Element at index 4 : 50



Type of variable:-

Basicelly variable is two type:
1- primitive variable

Primitive variables can be used to represent primitive values(datatype).
Example: 

int x=10;
float f=20;
double k=254d;
 




2-referance  Variable

Reference variables can be used to refer objects. 
Example: Student s=new Student(); 
**********************************************************************************************************
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Bihaviour type of Variable
 three type
 1- local variable
 2-instance variable
 3-Static variable
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 class Test{  
 int a=30; //Instance variable
 static int b=40; //Static variable

public static void main(String[] args){ 
       int a=10;  //Primitive VAriable 
     Test t=new Test(); //t is reference variable because t refer the object
        System.out.println(t.a);
		 System.out.println(b);
        ystem.out.println(Test.b);
   System.out.println(t.b);
         System.out.println("hdjsjdhi");
 

}

}



access specifier ot modifire:
1)  public 
2) private 
3) protected
4) static
5) final 
6) abstract

method:
methos of bolck of code its provide multiplr type of task
example:
suhani(){
	system.out.println("hello");
} //it is a method


*********************************************************************************************************

OOps
----------

object-->Any things is object 

class--> Class is the blueprint(Map) of the object

MetaDAta -->Data about  data is call mete data 
 ex :we can get more information of any data this process is meta data

cat-> i  already know domestic animal..
extra informations--> 
 ite eye is brown and its drink mailk 
 its fevorit food Rat(Mouse)
 


Abstraction:-
it is a  first part of oops
Hide our internal implemantation hightlight set of service is call Abstraction
example: ATM gui screen.
2 tv Remote function 


Incapulation:-binding of the data is corouponding method is a single unit call Incapulation.

Abstraction+ dataHiding== Incapulation

advantages:
1-easy to emplements
2-security achivemants
3-easy to maintain

disadvantage:
  code of length is increasing.



Inhertiance (Is A Relationship):-
it have extandes keyword 
Superclass or Parent class or Base class property by default available in child class or sub classes is call inheritance.
This is the most importance feature of oops.
it provides reuseable of the code.


type->
single 
multilevel
hyircial


multiple(Not support in java) || hybrid(Not support in java)
    Why java won't provide support for multiple inheritance? 
      There may be a chance of creating ambiguity problems


HAs A Relationship:

It is the combination of aggregation and composition.
This is the most importance feature of oops.
it provides reuseable of the code.

Aggregation:-

Without existing container object if there is a chance of existing contained objects such 
type of relationship is called aggregation.
 In aggregation objects have weak association.

Example: 
Within a department there may be a chance of several professors will work whenever 
we are closing department still there may be a chance of existing professor object 
without existing department object the relationship between department and professor 
is called aggregation where the objects having weak association


Composition: 
Without existing container object if there is no chance of existing contained objects this type of 
the relationship  is called composition 
which is a strong association.

Example: 
University consists of several departments whenever university object destroys 
automatically all the department objects will be destroyed that is without existing 
university object there is no chance of existing dependent object hence these are 
strongly associated and this relationship is called composition.

polimorphism:
same name different forms is call polimorphism.

example:
suhani(int x); 
suhani(int x, float y);
suhani(int x , int y);
suhani(int x, double d,long l);

types 

overloading or Runtime Polymorphism--> methode name same argument is different 
overriding  or Compile-time Polymorphism--> methode name same argument is also same and combination of parent and child is call overriding. 



final Keyword==>
The java final keyword can be used in many context
If we decelar final keyword we can not modyfying .

1 final method==>
final you make any method as final, you cannot override it.
  final void suhani(){}

2 final class===>
final you make any class as final, you cannot extends it.

final class Test{}

3 final variable===>
final you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable

ex 
final int a=10;


constructor==>
the main use of constructor is to perform initialization of an object.
class name and constructor name sould be same
it is the block of coad .

ex=>
class Test{
	Test()//This is constructor
	{
		//this and supper keyword
	}
	public static void mAin(String args[]){}
}
super and this===>
its use in constructor
The 1st line inside every constructor should be either super() or this() if we are not 
writing anything compiler will always generate super().

super====>
The super keyword  is a reference variable 
it  used to refer immediate parent class object.

Usage of Java super Keyword
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.



class Animal{  
String color="white";  
String color1="red";
String color2="yellow"; 
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
void printColor(){  
System.out.println("This is child object "+color);//prints color of Dog class  
System.out.println("This is Parrent object "+super.color);//prints color of Animal class  
System.out.println("This is Parrent object "+super.color);
System.out.println("This is Parrent object "+color2);
}  
}  
class TestSuper1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog d=new Dog();  
d.printColor();  
}}  




**********************************************************************************************************
Exception-------->
**********************************************************************************************************
An unwanted unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of the program is called exception.

The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

Example: 

A%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%B
TyrePunchuredException--

FileNotFoundException ...etc


TYpe of Exception---->
1  check exception--->compile-time check  
ex- file not found exception

2  Uncheck exception---Runtime check
ex- Airthmetic Exception

--------------------------------------------------------
How to handel exception
--------------------------------------------------------
using try and catch block whe can handel the exception 
try block have resky code
catch block have exception
class Test { 
public static void main(String [] args){
	   try{  
		   System.out.println(10/0);              
	   } 
	   catch(ArithmeticException e){
		   System.out.println("Airthmetic Exception "); 
	   }
	   catch(Exception e){
		   System.out.println(e);
	   }
}	
}

finally black>
 it is a keyword 
 its always excute
 its associated wit try and catch block.
 it main purpose cleanup the code.
 
 
 
 
final : 
 final is the modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables.
 If a class declared as the final then child class creation is not possible.
 If a method declared as the final then overriding of that method is not possible.
 If a variable declared as the final then reassignment is not possible.


finally: 
 finally is the block always associated with try-catch to maintain clean up code 
which should be executed always irrespective of whether exception raised or not 
raised and whether handled or not handled.

finalize-->
 finalize is a method, always invoked by Garbage Collector just before destroying 
an object to perform cleanup activities.

**********************************************************************************************************
MultiThreadind or MultiTasking

multi + tasking 
multi means multiple 
tasking means work.

Execute multiple task at a same time  and every task is independent is call multithreading  or multitasking

ex:
        While typing a java program in the editor we can able to listen mp3 audio songs 
at the same time we can download a file from the net and we are send a larg file using any web sender(teligranm ,facebook ) all these tasks are 
independent of each other and executing at a same time(simultaneously) and hence it is Process 
based multitasking.
 This type of multitasking is best suitable at "os level" 

type of multithreading
1. Process based multithreading
2. Thread based multithreading
